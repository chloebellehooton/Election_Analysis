# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Rather than use the typical method of excel, we are automating this via Python. These votes are coming from mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic counting machines. This voting report will be used to certify this election. This is a particularly important task, given the increased scrutiny put on vote counting measures in recent US elections.

## Election-Audit Summary
This successful audit shows that my code can not only be used for other congressional districts but also senatorial and other elections. It successfully shows the turnout by county, the winner, and the breakdowns for each category. This could be used to investigate the usage rates of each of the three voting sources if that were added to the data. Also, if there were demographic data we could analyze the differences in race/gender/age/etc for the voter turnout and for the votes to the candidates. With the data as-is, we could look at the breakdown of the votes per candidate by county.
